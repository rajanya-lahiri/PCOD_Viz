PCOD,1n265es,Considering laser hair removal on Chin and upper neck,"I'm a 23 year old Indian woman. Since 2020 I had started growing facial hair around my chin and lower jaw. Been diagnosed with pcos last September 2024 had a 17cc cyst and 2 missed periods earlier that year. I changed my lifestyle and had myoinositol and fenugreek water for 5 months, had regular periods( I was not on bc), lost 6kgs.

Went to the doctor in May 2025, did a usg and my reports were really good, no cysts or sol found. My only concern is my facial hair, my doctor told my hormones are a bit messed up and prescribed me Krimson 35 for 6 months.  I dont want to shave and irritated my skin anymore, tweezing was the worst mistake gave me hyperpigmentation. The  medication did help me, I noticed a bit less growth and some hair turned finer, in just 2 cycles, I have 4 yet to finish. I am intending to lose another 6kgs by the end of this year. I know the medication will not magically remove my facial hair because once the hair is terminal only destroying the follicles will remove it.

I was just wondering if starting laser now will be ideal for me as if affects my confidence so much.
The meds will keep the hormones under control and being on a healthy life style might help in regulation of the hormones.

Any insights will be helpful, any advice, i just want to feel normal for once and not be so conscious of my facial hair.

PCOD,1n2423m,"5 months since diagnosis (PCOD + thyroid)- meds, diets, tests","Hey everyone, this is my first post here.

I was diagnosed with PCOD and thyroid issues about 5 months ago, and honestly, I’ve been feeling super overwhelmed with all the conflicting information out there. I kept ignoring symptoms like irregular periods, constant hair fall, brittle nails, low energy, and mood swings for years. I just assumed it was “normal stress.” But now everything feels like it’s catching up to me.

I have a few major concerns and would love some guidance from people who’ve actually been through this:

* What diet changes worked for you?
* Do you take any supplements that genuinely made a difference?
* What tests should I ask my doctor for to understand the actual root cause (especially for hair thinning, fatigue, etc.)?

I’ve visited a couple of gynecologists, but I feel like all I ever get told is “just lose weight,” and then they put me on hormonal medication. It’s frustrating because it feels like nobody is addressing the bigger picture, and it’s really taking a toll on my mental health.

PCOD,1kzd88i,🩺 Am I Really PCOD or Just Normal? Confused After My Ultrasound…,"Hey everyone,
I could use some help understanding my health better. I recently had an ultrasound, and it showed multiple small cysts (2-3 mm) in my ovaries. Naturally, I panicked a bit—does this mean I have PCOD?

But here’s the thing:
My periods are regular. once an year they get to 35-40 days otherwise it's 28 days regularly.


TSH levels are normal. But I have a lot of HAIRFALL


No significant facial hair, no major acne. But I have weight gain issues but I think that's because of my long hours sitting job.



Apart from these small cysts, I feel mostly okay.

So, I’m wondering:

Can you have cysts without actually having PCOD?

Is it possible these small cysts are just normal and not a sign of a hormonal problem?

Has anyone else been told they have ""PCOD"" just because of cysts but turned out to be fine?


Would love to hear your thoughts and experiences! 💬

Thanks in advance for any insights 🌸

PCOD,1kx8uj0,Homeopathy/ayurveda/aleopathy    which one to take for pcod?,"**Medical history**

I am 20 yr F. Around a year back I was diagnosed with PCOS. It started with skipping periods for months. Then my gynac gave me birth control pills(2 months course). Then for the next month everything was fine. Then again my periods became irregular, this time it was PCOD. I went to another gynac who gave me similar course. Except this time I got an increased sugar level after taking the medicine along with other side effects. Since then I am avoiding aleopathy.

 So I tried ayurveda instead. The doctor gave me medicines like ashokarishth, kumaraswa,lohasva etc. My periods started coming regularly  for 3 months(with improvement in report) But then again they started lasting longer than usual. After running some test I was still diagnosed with PCOD with increase in TSH. 

I never had any weight gain throughout (50kg constant). I experienced hair thinning, facial hair growth.

Honestly I am fed up now . Earlier I skipped periods then I not i get them but they last for 20 days straight. I found ayurveda most effective of all treatments till now as it didnt have side effects and made me feel energized...but now i am reconsidering.

**Lifestyle**

I exercise regularly. I have been increasingly eating junk food since past few months. Though it is still not much as larger amount of my meal is cooked in mess and usualy is daal,roti,sabzi(heavy gravy dishes),salad. I sleep for 7 hrs but since last few months  I found trouble sleeping. Since I have recently started living in a hostel ,lot of things have changed about my diet. I was a little stressed since last few months due to toxic roommate issues. I also had some confusion in taking the medicine in between. I do not have any family history of anything.

PCOD,1j4pwgs,Spotting but no periods in 2 weeks what to do next,"Hey everyone 

A couple of weeks ago, I noticed blood spotting twice in my white discharge. Since then, I still haven’t gotten my period. Took pregnancy test twice both came negative and I'm not sexually active from last 2 months.

 I consulted two gynecologists and they said your period will come in a week or so. They suggested I take inositol supplements. But still no luck.

For context, I have PCOD, and my periods usually come once every three months. 
The spotting followed by no period for this long is making me anxious.

PCOD,1hj9nmv,Emotional health ,"Due to PCOD, I'm facing a lot of problems managing my emotions.  I stay busy while at workplace, and during that time, I feel okay because I don't have time to overthink. But as soon as I come home, the flood of overthinking starts again. I try my best to control it, but after 2-3 days, the same flood of emotions returns. I'm completely exhausted from trying to manage myself.
It feels like running away somewhere far from home is the only escape. I don't understand anything, and on top of that, my family is going through a phase of looking for a life partner for me. Just hearing about it makes me even more  depressed and agitated.
How to tackle this? Anyone please share ideas

PCOD,1gs3ij3,Skin care,"I was diagnosed with PCOD a month ago, and while I initially didn’t think it would affect me much, I’ve started noticing changes.

PCOD,1e8en79,"Query: Relation between gut health, pcod, protein and dairy?","Hello everyone! This is my first query on Reddit. I have been tackling high prolactin since a few months - 90 and above. Cabergoline does not suit me and I have tried it in the past. I do not want to rely on allopathy medicines so trying to look for an alternative. I do get frequent headaches, fatigue. I was on a high protein diet 90-100g for 6 months last year (weighing 83kg and lost 14kg over 1 year). For rest of the last year, I switched to a vegetarian diet and consumed more dairy - for example a typical day of 70g protein would be 1-2 scoop whey isolate, 1 cup yoghurt, 50g cheese. I quit whey isolate past two months and shifted to 150g paneer(fresh cheese), 1 cup curd, 1cup milk in a day. I was on the diet with a nutritionist since the past year. I lost the weight, but my periods are still not regular, and have had the need to go for Primolut every now and then. Fatigue, breast tenderness, nausea is even more now.

I started having stomach cramps since 2-3 months and having trouble going through the whole quantities of dairy, I would still eat it inspite of pain. I would get stomach pain even with some restaurant food which never happened before. 

I have recently consulted an ayurvedic doctor, and she has asked me to go off gluten, fresh cheese, curd, milk, wheat, fermented foods, coffee as she feels all are inflammatory for gut and atleast a few months with herbal medicines. She feels prolactin will go down with cutting dairy. It has been really difficult for me to cut out all these food sources, since being an indian, its super tough to cut out these food groups. I would like to know of any of your experiences or any knowledge on pcod relating to the above. ",2024-07-21 01:02:07,2,0,"Query: Relation between gut health, pcod, protein and dairy? Hello everyone!

PCOD,1dh7ry7,"Extreme Fatigue, Swelling, Tingling - Looking for Advice (Mitral Valve Prolapse, PCOD)","Hi everyone,

I'm(25F) feeling really lost and hoping someone might have some insight. I've been dealing with extreme fatigue for the past two years, some days are better than others, but it's always there. Most of the days even showering feels like too much effort.

Recently, I was diagnosed with PCOD, though my periods are regular and last about 7 days.  

My symptoms:
1) Extreme fatigue
2) Swelling on my hands, feet, and especially my left leg and right hand.
3) Tingling sensation in my left leg.
4) Strange feeling of exhaustion after drinking water.
5) Wounds and scars that heal very slowly.
6) low to zero appetite.

I've had blood work done and everything seems mostly normal, except for:

1) Low fasting insulin (glucose levels are normal) 
2) High prolactin

I also have mild mitral valve prolapse, which was diagnosed in 2022, but I haven't had any symptoms related to that.

Has anyone else experienced anything similar? what other tests I might need or what might help me overcome this. 

Thanks in advance for any help!

""I've been dealing with PCOS since I was 15, and like many, I initially turned to pills for relief. However, the side effects, both physical and mental, were overwhelming. Eventually, I decided to take a different path and focus on living a healthier lifestyle.

PCOS seemed like a vicious cycle affecting my sleep, mental health, metabolism, and more. Each symptom worsened the others, creating a challenging situation. After quitting the pills, I embarked on a journey to address all aspects simultaneously.

It wasn't easy. It took over a year to see improvements, but I was determined. I tried various approaches like improving sleep, managing anxiety, acupuncture, herbal medicine, and cutting out sugar. Surprisingly, some changes, like cutting sugar, made a significant difference in my acne.

Acupuncture became a lifeline for my mental health, despite its cost. I even learned how to do it myself, albeit less effectively. Better sleep was a game-changer, impacting all aspects of my health positively.

I want to emphasize the importance of a holistic approach. PCOS symptoms are interconnected, and addressing one alone isn't enough. It's about taking care of your body as a whole.

Today, waking up to a natural period feels like a victory. It's a sign that my body trusts me and that I'm on the right path to health and healing. If my journey can inspire even one person with PCOS, then it's worth sharing.""",2024-05-03 05:58:48,9,7,"Got my period back after years

PCOD,fscwyk,MY JOURNEY WITH PCOD,"Hey guys!

I am here to share my story, to hopefully help someone and let them know that they can get through this journey and to trust the process.

I suffered from PCOD from when I was 13 years old. When I hit puberty, I used to get  extremely long periods, which would last for a month, and I would get the next cycle within 14 days which would last again for a month. Seeing, that I got pale after 2 cycles my mom took to a gynec and she gave me pills to stop my period for a particular period of time. Each pill had a dosage of 650 g which is quite heavy considering our ovaries weigh only 4-8 gms. But, later on I started getting my periods once every three months and the flow was quite heavy. Though my cycles were inconsistent the other symptoms that started showing up were quite self-demeaning.

I had thick (like thicc)mustache growing and a small beard that started to sprout. My hair started falling and I had EXTREME acne. My acne was so bad,I had acne forming on top of a pre-existing layer of acne. Not to mention, I started gaining weight. The same doctor who gave me pills to stop my periods diagnosed my PCOD. I was given a set of birth control pills.

I tried taking those pills but as a 13 year old it made me extremely nauseous and made me puke everyday at 4am(specifically) right before I went to school.  I started drifting towards homeopathy hoping to get results but they never went away. Nor did my irregular period. I was advised by a physician to see a  nutritionist and she was the firs person who told me, I needed to lose weight. Like mass amount of weight. She explained what I was diagnosed with carefully, and told me how it can cause death if not taken care of, properly.

I was advised to see an endocrinologist after this and I had my hormone levels tested at serum level and I was constantly advised to lose weight by him.Although, I never took it seriously, one day it just dawned on me if I feel insecure about my body only I can change it. If my body is crying for help then only I can save it, the pills can make my work easier but it can never completely cure me without my effort to heal myself. I started working out,while I was put on glycomet and atorva (metformin) which helped me not to gain weight. And I lost 15 kilos by doing Bipasha Basu's cardio workout everyday religiously \[I will insert a link down below if anyone is ineterested\].

I was 16 when I met my endocrinologist, I am 20 now. PCOD has been with me throughout most of my teenage years. It has made me look at myself in disgust,made me feel so worthless, to a point where I'd never look at myself in the mirror properly. I've been there. I feel you. The most important thing that you should know is, do it for your body even if you don't feel like doing it. The stress of not being good enough just because of how you look has been with me my entire life, because of PCOD. Even if I'm okay because I balanced my weight and diet, thanks to yoga and exercise I still feel insecure when I look at myself sometimes. But hey, it's okay, because I've learnt to appreciate myself more. I hope you find the resilience to get through this journey even if you don't like it.",2020-03-31 09:29:05,15,10,"MY JOURNEY WITH PCOD Hey guys!

PCOS,1dy9toa,A note about supplement brands you may see on social media,"We have been seeing a *lot* of posts recently about various supplement brands that are being aggressively advertised in PCOS spaces on tiktok, instagram, etc.


please understand that even though what you're seeing may look like an organic review of the product, they are often paid by the manufacturer. this advertising strategy is designed to trick you into thinking that lots of influential people on a particular platform are talking about these supplements when they are not. it's bought and paid for.


now I cannot say what supplements will or will not work for any individual person with PCOS. but I can say that a lot of these products with slick marketing and cutesy branding are predatory.


why?


for one, the effective ingredients with actual scientific evidence to support their use are often dosed below what is considered effective. you are paying more for less effective ingredients and a whole bunch of *ineffective* ingredients that allow them to market it as a ""proprietary blend ""


for another, these companies often work on a subscription-based model. the product is automatically shipped and if you forget to cancel oh well, you've paid for another month. this model can work for some people who want it, but it can also be predatory and intentionally difficult to cancel. if you buy a regular bottle of supplements from the store and don't like it, you simply don't buy it again. but if you're subscribed to a service that *delivers* that same bottle of supplements to you the onus is now on *you* to cancel that subscription or you'll continue to automatically pay for bottles of product at whatever price they decide to charge you. slick, huh?


in short: keep your wits about you and buyer beware. the supplement industry is shockingly unregulated, and with PCOS there are a lot of people desperately looking for that special supplement that will bring relief. unfortunately that makes us a wide open market for less than scrupulous businesses.


does this mean these supplements will not work for you? not necessarily. you might get results at the dose they are offering. but you will get a much better deal by seeking out the right dose of the effective ingredients from a more reputable manufacturer. and be on the lookout for filler products. no, chamomile and fennel are probably not going to help balance your hormones or ""de-bloat"" you. be realistic when evaluating these products and *read the ingredients!*
 

where should you actually spend your money? what supplements are actually supported by the scientific evidence? below is a short list:


* **INOSITOL** in a 40:1 ratio of myo to d-chiro. 4g/day, half in the morning and half in the evening. please be sure to calculate the cost per dose on this one. there are many brands out there that *appear* to be a cheaper option but are actually charging more for less.


* **BERBERINE** if you are unable to access or tolerate metformin (metformin has a superior safety profile and is better regulated as a pharmaceutical drug.) Please do your research on the best way to take this one, as it is evolving. there are some potential negative outcomes associated with long-term use.


* **NAC** 600-1800mg/day (start low and work your way up) in 2-3 doses throughout the day.


* **FISH OIL/OMEGA 3/DHA** 1,000-2,000mg/day. once again, start low and work up. 2,000mg/day is considered the therapeutic dose for chronic inflammation. some people do take more than this with good results, and it's a good question for your doctor. 


* **VITAMIN D** get tested!! many people with PCOS are low in vitamin D, and your doctor can recommend an appropriate therapeutic dose. the best first step if you suspect you *may* be deficient is to spend some time in the sunshine when the weather permits. the sun is the most bioavailable source of vitamin D. 


* **MAGNESIUM GLYCINATE** start with a low dose of 200-400mg before bed. this promotes muscle relaxation and improved sleep, which is essential for managing PCOS.


* **SPEARMINT** can be taken as a tea or a capsule. a weak, natural anti-androgen that helps some people with symptoms like acne and hirsutism. there is no established therapeutic dose that I am aware of, since it is most commonly taken as tea.

an important thing to note is that just because the supplements I've listed above are broadly backed by scientific evidence does not guarantee that they will work for *you.* there is no study that I am aware of in the PCOS literature where a supplement or medication provided relief to 100% of the subjects enrolled. it's entirely possible that you might be one of the unlucky people who take NAC or inositol or whatever and just get weird side effects or expensive pee out of it. don't keep taking a supplement that doesn't work for you just because you see success stories online.


beyond this list, certain individuals might benefit from additional supplements due to a specific condition or deficiency. please do not assume that *you* have a deficiency simply because you have PCOS, you could do more harm than good. 


I should note that there are other supplements in the pipeline that are undergoing testing for PCOS and associated disorders, but these are the ones that we have decently solid evidence for right now. in the future, the list might be longer... I, for one, certainly hope it is!


*to conclude: please do not let these designer vitamin brands and their army of influencers convince you that dandelion pollen and parsley seed extract are ancient cures for hormone imbalance that you should pay $60/mo for.*",2024-07-08 10:07:47,750,124,"A note about supplement brands you may see on social media We have been seeing a *lot* of posts recently about various supplement brands that are being aggressively advertised in PCOS spaces on tiktok, instagram, etc.

PCOS,1o4w0oi,Period won’t stop,"
Hey all, this is a loaded question. So stick with me .
I’m 26 and I have PCOS. my cycles for the most part were regular. Expect this summer. 
So my last normal cycle was the  week of May 26th

In June and July, August , I was on and off brown spotting .

Then finally , September . My period started flowing red on September 9th . I have always had heavy cycles. I have not stopped bleeding sense. I am going through heavy pads like crazy. 
This was a new level of heavy. The clots are much thicker. Like more than a dime - quarter . 
I am not cramping at all. It would stop for a day then creep back to a heavy flow. ( more like moderate flow) 
In addition, I do have anemia and vitamin d levels.
I have been taking both supplements but no difference. 

I really don’t want to be on birth control again. But I do have a feeling it’s fibroids… 

What do you think this is?? 
I’m so worried. My coworker said she saw that some of my nail beds were blue. 😅

In addition, I do have anemia and vitamin d levels.
I have been taking both supplements but no difference. 

I really don’t want to be on birth control again. But I do have a feeling it’s fibroids… 

What do you think this is?? 
I’m so worried. My coworker said she saw that some of my nail beds were blue. 😅

i’ve always had an irregular cycle, but even when i have gone months without a period, when i do eventually get it back it’s just normal. i’ve never had my entire body weight in blood coming out of me?? like should i be concerned? i feel fine besides the cramps. and like do i need to go to the store and buy diapers or what?😭 idk how i’m even supposed to go to work if i have to change my tampon every 5 minutes.😭

PCOS,1o4ruzd,Testosterone,"Hey so I wanted some advice on my current situation. I'm new to actually giving a shit about my pcos, my gp is useless (she told me to come back when i have a pregnancy plan) and I've asked for a referral to a gyno and have heard nothing from that front either. what can i do now? i plan to call the gyno on monday but now im rethinking that referral, is it an endocrinologist that i need instead?

how do you combat the dismissal of healthcare? the only help ive gotten with regulating my periods was through tiktok, and i feel like its harder to find stuff on hair loss and chin hair. I also really want to find the root cause and fix that and theres no way i could do that without professional help.

my current symptoms are chin hair, hair loss, and weight that wont budge. im 20, 5'5 and my weight stays between 90kg to 95kg. i only recently got my periods regulated for the past 2 months by going to the gym regularly. ive only had basic blood tests (bc idk what to ask for) and theyve not shown any pre diabetes, so when people say they used berberine, metformin, inositol for weightloss im scared to try them because dont those all lower blood sugar? if my blood tests are normal surely i dont need that and itll have worse effects? but then what is my high testosterone (chin hair, hair loss) caused by if not insulin resistance? 

i dont binge eat at all, i have no acne and i rarely snack yet my weight wont budge? even after starting weight training at the gym. i actually started eating more healthy (balanced meals, more fibre) and feel like ive just gained weight. i dont track calories, but id estimate that my daily intake is roughly 1800 to 2000.

PCOS,1o4rc9g,3+ months without a period and im starting to get really anxious (also im having brown discharge that looks like blood clot but they're not),"Hey girls, so ive had irregular period since menarche. After my 1st period, I had my second period after 6-8 months. I always had heavy flow and need to change at least 3-4 pads everyday for at least first 3 days and then 4th and 5th day its normal and I do have some spotting on 6th day as well. But from last 3 years no matter what I do I just don't get my periods naturally (one reason could be stress bc I was preparing for an exam) but this year my periods have been extremely irregular. I tried taking medicine, infact I took it for 3 months and first two months my periods were normal but the 3rd month I didn't get my period at all even after taking the medicine so I stopped. 

After that I consulted an ayurvedic doctor, I started taking his medicines and I got my period but bc I wasn't consistent in taking medicines for at least 3-5 months, my periods became irregular again. In June I had very less blood flow and my period lasted about only 2 days. In July my brown discharge started so I thought my periods will come but they didn't come and now in oct I'm having brown discharge again. Sometimes I have cramps but I still don't get my periods. 

Ive got my blood test and thyroid test done but everything was normal. Even my ultra sound was normal. One of the doctors had the audacity to say that its normal why are u worried you're not getting married anytime soon but I'm worried sick about my health. I have gained a lot of weight in really short amount of time. 

My height is 152cms and I'm 22 and my weight is 61 kgs. I started walking daily and managed to loose 2-3 kgs but I gained it all back when I stopped walking. I'm pretty alone, I have no friend, except my roommate. I do cycle 25-35 mins almost everyday (for college) and have medium activity throughout the day. I tried cardio for 30 days (when my roommate was not around) but that didn't help too so I gave up. Also I'm facing hair thinning. Since I live in a dorm and have to eat whatever they cook in the mess (I don't cook bc I don't have time) so my diet is not healthy or clean either.  I'm also facing hair thinning but im experimenting with mixing different oils but I haven't seen any drastic change in my hair fall (but my hairs are softer now). 

I think I'm lost, pls help me, where do i even start?
I'm so insecure about my weight and my hair and no matter how much I try I can't lose weight. I need some serious advice.

PCOS,1o4wl2h,Bald Spots At Temples For Years,"So, I always had pretty thick hair as a child. I would be called wooly mammoth by my family because of how thick and untameable my hair was at one point. (Black Girl with type 4 hair, not sure of the letter).

So, come up on either early or mid high school (I graduated in 2019) I had bald spots on my temples, right above the ear area. The rest of my head, still had plenty of thick hair (I hope that nothing is happening to the rest of my head). I did a big chop my senior year of high school so maybe 2018/2019 because I had a relaxer put in when I was younger and finally wanted to embrace my natural hair.

I love my natural hair and have been growing it out ever since. My hair is almost at the middle of my back now, but the bald spots remain.

I initially thought I had bald spots from like traction alopecia and regularly wearing my hair up in ponytails and such (student athlete and hated my hair being in my face) I also thought it was from wearing braids. But, no matter what I do. I have officially stopped wearing braid extensions and decided to just braid my natural hair up, to protect it and help it grow without playing in it.

It's been 6 maybe even more years, since these two bald spots on my temples appeared. Even one of my teammates noticed at the time.

I don't understand why, the rest of my hair is fine but my temples just won't grow in. My mom keeps saying to oil there but, I oil my hair along with water and leave in conditioner usually but, my temples still won't grow in while the rest of my hair continues to gain length.

I was diagnosed with PCOS maybe... 2-3 years ago now. I was probably living with it during high school with my irregular periods and such. It wasn't until the pandemic/post-pandemic did the symptoms come roaring (facial hair, extreme obesity, etc.)

I am still struggling with diet and exercise now that I'm no longer in high school and I know that is the start of PCOS management but, it still doesn't explain my hair.

I went to a dermatologist maybe twice, but they weren't much help and just gave me a topical oil to try (didn't help). I was offered to try injections too at the time but I wanted to try other options first. They also did blood work and they only call if there is issue. Which they didn't so I guess my blood panel was fine. I am also taking a vitamin d supplement from my primary doctor (before I lost insurance) because that was a bit low but, I'm almost done with it.

Now, I no longer have health insurance (broke college student) so, I wouldn't be able to go see another dermatologist for a little while or at least until my insurance with medi-cal (California, medical insurance) is fixed.

I usually get outsourced to a dermatologist from Kaiser but, I feel like they haven't been much help and it takes months to see a dermatologist anyway.

Do you guys know what could be wrong? Even when my hairline got thin from braids or it was also in ponytails, it grew back fine and I have plenty of baby hairs, it's just the temples that refuse to grow anything.

What should I do? I am obese, I was on wegovy (before insurance was canceled) but I only got to try the lowest dose for a month and when I get back on insurance, I'll need to start the whole process again. So, weight loss has been the complete opposite with me regaining like all of my weight loss from the past 2 years.

Though, through that period of weight loss, there wasn't much improvement on my bald spots either. Which, I thought was supposed to help if you have insulin resistance or high testosterone.

Any help would be greatly appreciated on what I should do next. I would like to not use a medication for the rest of my life for it. I don't mind taking medication for a while though. I don't have much money to spend on endless different treatment options either at the moment.

PCOS,1o523c0,update on endocrinologist and metformin,"Hello everyone!

I’m posting an update based on my og post (I can link the original it’s just a bit embarrassing) tldr I felt like I was out of options and thought I needed to get added sugar out of my diet at all cost.

All lot of you, thankfully told me not to do that and if I want to eat sweets to eat them mindfully.. thank you for that.

Since then, I’ve gone to the endocrinologist about two and a half months ago and they prescribed me with metformin. I had said I didn’t like the idea of taking birth control because of the side effects and we did a blood test to see if I was a good candidate for metformin. I had fasted and my regular blood sugar was good and my insulin was on the lower normal range and that I could take metformin as my insulin is a bit lower than regular the nurse said.

They prescribed it, started taking it and three weeks later I GOT MY PERIOD it was amazing and the only thing that sucked is I was unprepared and bleed during a 3 hour car ride and had to go to class after :,) (I missed class and went home btw!) nonetheless I was over joyed :)

It’s been great and I get my period again sometime next week and will update again in six months time probably.

One thing, that has been bothering me however, is I get headaches 5 time a week once per day and it’s when I make a sudden movement with my head and its as if someone is squeezing my head hard with there hands for 10 seconds and then It goes away until the next time.

I’ve never really had headaches before or migraines until I started taking metformin is it a side effect anyone else has felt? I’ve also heard metformin lowers B12 so that’s something :o

Overall, I’m very pleased and If your struggling with your period visit your gyno or endo and they’ll help you out and metformin isn’t always the cure to pcos or a symptom reliever as everyone is different!

That’s all thank you for taking the time to read my update and hope y’all have a great day!

PCOS,1o4qgro,"Having spotting for 6 days, what should I do?","
Hey guys
I have had PCOS due to insulin resistance since 2020. My periods are really unpredictable. Sometimes they come regularly for a few months every 30 days, and then suddenly the cycle stretches to 50 or even 60 days.

Right now I have been spotting for the past 6 days. My last proper period was on 21 August 2025. I know I should probably see a doctor, but honestly my experiences with gynecologists have not been great. One doctor told me not to worry about my periods since I am not trying to get pregnant and just asked me to eat 1200 calories a day and exercise. That was it. No medicine, no supplements, nothing.

I understand that diet and exercise are important for PCOS, but sometimes lifestyle changes alone do not make your periods regular. And irregular periods are not just about pregnancy. They also mean hormonal imbalance, which causes low energy, mood swings, body pain, and now this spotting.

I am really tired of this and do not know what to do. Should I try drinking ginger water to induce my period or is that useless? Has anyone else gone through something like this?",2025-10-12 10:27:25,2,1,"Having spotting for 6 days, what should I do?

My dietitian has me on a diet of 1600 calories with 120g of protein and less than 80g of carbs.

I asked about this on a weight loss thread and they said its impossible to be gaining weight on a calorie deficit even with pcos and I must be doing something wrong. I just wanted to double check that that is true? 

I dont feel like im missing anything the only thing I dont count is seasonings... Ive been measuring my food as much as possible but I dont have access to a food scale for meat. 

Has anyone else had this experience? ",2025-10-11 20:19:26,15,33,"Gaining Weight on Calorie Defecit Hii! Im 18f and 330lbs.

PCOS,1o4f2ys,Help! I’ve been doing everything and my PCOS still won’t budge,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been battling PCOS for years and I’m honestly at my breaking point. I have every symptom you can think of: hair thinning, anxiety, a messed-up relationship with food and my body, and weight that refuses to move no matter what I do.

I’ve been consistent with workouts and eating clean. My diet is literally one whole egg and one egg white for breakfast, psyllium husk, grilled chicken or sprouts and carrots for lunch, psyllium husk again around 5 PM, and that’s it. These days I’m so frustrated I just skip dinner altogether.

I take minoxidil, folic acid, multivitamins, everything. I’ve cut out stress as much as I can. But nothing changes. My hair keeps thinning, my weight doesn’t shift, and it’s exhausting.

What’s worse is that all of this just gives me more stress. I feel angry all the time. I end up crying in my bedroom or bathroom more often than I’d like to admit. I feel like I’m doing everything right but still losing.

If anyone has actually seen progress with PCOS, please tell me what helped. Hair, weight, mood, anything. I just want to feel like myself again.

I am turning 33 soon, and I plan to get married in the coming year. I do not think I will be emotionally ready to have children if I am a mess like this. ",2025-10-11 23:45:07,7,14,"Help! I’ve been doing everything and my PCOS still won’t budge Hey everyone,

PCOS,1o4d4p4,Eating While On Metformin?,"Apologies in advance for the dumb questions, but I am looking for some guidance.

I just started Merformin tonight. One dose with dinner (500mg) for the first week and then slowly titrating up. I have a normal A1C and am probably IR (never formally tested for it). No side effects YET, but I'm sure they may start in the next day or two. I already have a notoriously bad GI system and IBS.

My questions:

#1:) On Metformin, should I be eating throughout the day? Or is breakfast, lunch, dinner fine? I had never been much of a throughout-the-day eater prior to my PCOS diagnosis but have been trying to adopt a healthier lifestyle.

#2:) Should I NOT be eating certain things on this medication? For example, I am going out next week for a party to a pizza restaurant. Is eating pizza a bad idea on Metformin? What about the occasional dessert or indulgence?

PCOS,1o41amv,Metformin Journey and Ghost pills,"Background: Hello I was on metformin for ages (years upon years) for PCOS and about two-three weeks ago my dr had me withhold it because she was worried it was causing the upper GI distress I was having, unfortunately she started me on a PPI at the same time so...chicken and egg on trying to figure out what solved the problem. So any way I am on BC pills and I skip my period entirely (which is not normal for me. I have been pretty regulated, but this is two months now without a full bleed). I start gaining weight, my fasting sugar goes up....so I msg my doctor and say I want to restart metformin ASAP please. 

Question and update: ReStarted it yesterday. 500 mg ER at night. took it about 630pm and by 1130pm my bowels were moving SO fast. I have lost 2 pounds overnight. I normally am constipated so this was relieving but then I saw a ghost pill this morning at 930 am. I am not a stranger to the ghost pill but is that long enough for it to actually digest or is this more than a ghost pill? I've seen plenty on here posting about it but I can directly say when the last one I had in weeks and transit time is short (less than 24 hours). 

I also had recently been noted as iron deficient leaning towards anemia, b12 deficient (but when I take them it makes me sleepy), and generally lower potassium.

PCOS,1o4jmkv,Onion cure that gave me regular periods,"
I was diagnosed PCOS at 15 years old, had irregular periods up to 3-4 months in between, excessive hair growth etc. I was given birth control (🙄) and used it for 8 years which didn’t heal me, only masked my symptoms. 

After trying a natural solution once, the onion cure, I never had to use birth control ever again, I’m having regular periods for +5 years (for me it’s a legit miracle)

Now listen, I am not the type to ever believe in herbal medicinal blah blah, BUT it healed me tremendously and now I spread it to everyone woman I know. I never post on Reddit, but this must be heard by more women. As my mom convinced me to try it with these words: what to lose. 

The cure is simple, cheap, short term. It is actually very known in Turkiye and if you go to Turkish forums you can find so many women healing their periods with it (it is also widely used for getting pregnant for women with pcos) 

2 ingredients: 1 brown onion 🧅 and water 💧
Peel the onion, cut it in 4, toss it into a boiling cup of water. Keep on boiling the water for 5 minutes with a lid on. After it’s cooled down a bit, drink the water. (Taste is not good but not bad, but totally worth it)

You must start the cure after 3 days after the end of your period. Drink it with empty stomach 2 times a day for 15 days, each time prepared freshly.

I didn’t do it religiously, I missed it some days and dreaded drinking it. After 10 days, I remember feeling my ovaries being sort of “filled” with water, I was like huh, interesting. Afterwards I finished 15 days, for the first time ever, I got my period in 30 days cycle. I never went back to birth control ever again. 

I repeated it only once after many years, when my period got messed up due to stressful times, and it fixed it again.

Now if you wonder the the background of this cure is a Turkish Professor in Biochemistry and Microbiology, he is well known in Turkey due to his natural remedies, Ibrahim Saracoglu, if you want to look up. 

I hope you see the results yourself, much love. ",2025-10-12 04:20:39,0,2,"Onion cure that gave me regular periods

PCOS,1o41c1p,Found out in a bad way and have strong feelings,"I had to have bloodwork and an internal ultrasound sound and it took them over three weeks to look at any of it. I had that done because even though Im on birth control I was bleeding for 9 days. Well, they finally called me after they had time to look. It was a receptionist and she says ""your bloodwork is all normal, but she looked at the scan and you have pcos ovaries"" Not, my ovaries have cysts. Just that my ovaries ARE Pcos. She doesnt let me schedule an appointment and says ""we'll call you to have another ultrasound in six months."" Im just so confused. She didnt even tell me how bad the cysts are? I dont fully understand what she meant by pcos ovaries. I have had irregular periods and was always told that it was fine, that it happens. Im on birth control due to the fact that my periods used to be so, so heavy and painful that I was stuck in bed crying. I dont know what to do, if I can insist they see me and explain? Im scared, and just so... disappointed. I looked at medical recourses and im supposed to give up carbs, dairy and sugar and I know its silly but I don't have many things to enjoy. Food was IT. My one little enjoyment every day was some cheese and sweet iced tea. But now it looks like I cant have that? And- no snacking? I have to fast?? I get so sick when I dont eat. I have high cholesterol but was trying my best. I use oat milk. I added so many veggies. Its not enough? I just... it feels dumb to be so upset over this. But im autistic and have bad depression. Which- now i wonder if pcos impacted that? My cycle seems to impact my mood. My parents are... somewhat supportive but dont get it. I just wish the doctor had called. Asked me to come in.

I had that done because even though Im on birth control I was bleeding for 9 days. Well, they finally called me after they had time to look. It was a receptionist and she says ""your bloodwork is all normal, but she looked at the scan and you have pcos ovaries"" Not, my ovaries have cysts. Just that my ovaries ARE Pcos. She doesnt let me schedule an appointment and says ""we'll call you to have another ultrasound in six months."" Im just so confused. She didnt even tell me how bad the cysts are? I dont fully understand what she meant by pcos ovaries. I have had irregular periods and was always told that it was fine, that it happens. Im on birth control due to the fact that my periods used to be so, so heavy and painful that I was stuck in bed crying. I dont know what to do, if I can insist they see me and explain? Im scared, and just so... disappointed. I looked at medical recourses and im supposed to give up carbs, dairy and sugar and I know its silly but I don't have many things to enjoy. Food was IT. My one little enjoyment every day was some cheese and sweet iced tea. But now it looks like I cant have that? And- no snacking? I have to fast?? I get so sick when I dont eat. I have high cholesterol but was trying my best. I use oat milk. I added so many veggies. Its not enough? I just... it feels dumb to be so upset over this. But im autistic and have bad depression.

I'm really struggling and don't know where to start. My labs have indicators of either pcos or early menopause (I'm 25), but I am on tricare and getting in anywhere has been next to impossible. 

I have depression, low energy, and severely irregular and painful periods (currently just started my period 4 days after my last one ended, which was 13 days long), and a bit of acne. My blood sugar is normal, sometime a bit on the low end (usually between 80-110), I do not have any irregular hair growth and I have a hard time keeping weight on as opposed to keeping it off.

PCOS,1o3ztjc,Inositol and Berberine: How would you say is the best way to take them?,"Hey all, 

Pretty new to reddit. I jumped on for some support regarding a new diagnosis. My OB has found that after years of struggle with my periods. I have PCOS and the insulin resistance is doing quite a number to my fertile health. I had been TTC for a few months prior to this visit and it was pretty hard to hear. 

To make a long story short my doctor recommended Inositol and Berberine. I purchased some from walmart and started taking them today but i wonder if i need to start small before doing the full amount? The Inositol is 2000mg with 2 tablets and Berberine is 1200mg with 2 capsules. Should i cut the dose in half first? 

Also would love to know some experiences with the two. How they helped, what to look out for when taking them, what should i do to help myself and ensure that taking them will help me successfully.

Cw: 68 kg

After 1.5 year of the most irregular and miserable I've been menstrually and begging  doctors to take me seriously, I have finally been diagnosed. PCOS. The amount of relief I feel is great but now what?

My consultation with the specialist went as follows

\----------------------------------------------------

Doctor: From the ultrasoind we can see that you have an abnormally high amount of follicles in your ovaries. This alongside your other symptoms allows me to diagnosis you with PCOS. Let's order a hormone blood panel for you and we will go from there. For now let's try to get you to a gym and losing weight since you're overwright. 

Me: Yea I go to the gym 4-5x a week and follow a diet plan provided by a dietist. I've lost 30 kg but over the past year my weightloss has dramatically stalled.

Him: hm ok well let's discuss it next week after we get your blood test results. Maybe an IUD will help.

\----------------------------------------------------

I have access to my blood results now (my next appointment to discuss these results is this coming Thursday) but it shows that my testosterone and free testosterone are elevated. Of course I plan to adjust my life style to better fit a PCOS lifestyle (whatever that means, still need to learn) but will an IUD help lower my testosterone? I kind of feel like just suggesting a contraceptive is a bandaid on the issue. Over the past year I dealt with convincing my doctor that taking the pill wasn't working for me anymore ( I have always had awful menstrual issues but it had never been diagnosed as pcos until now). And I don't have to go through all that anymore. 

So I would appreciate opinions on next steps. Should I demand to have my insulin checked? Since I have high testosterone and a family history of type 2 diabetes? And if it's the case I am insulin resistant should I ask for metformin? A glp-1? A combo of an IUD (for my irregular/painful periods) and a medicaiton ? The combo of there being so much information out there and having doctors that I have to convince to take me seriously is a little overwhelming. 

I'm not sure what should be my next steps.",2025-10-11 10:57:59,1,2,"Diagnosed with PCOS... now what> F26

I've had endocrinology tests, thyroid medicated, got rid of psychiatric meds which kept me functional but made the sweating worse to the point of wanting to end it. But it's come back even when I'm on zero of sweating-inducing psych meds. It's not anxiety sweating, there's a difference.

Breakfast (~300 cal)
Greek Yogurt Power Bowl
¾ cup plain nonfat Greek yogurt
½ small banana (or ¼ cup berries if you prefer less sweetness)

PCOS,1o3tfqq,Very confused about blood test results. Any doctors/experience experts here?,"Hey everyone,

I’ve recently had a lot of labs and tests done to see what the status quo is with my body.

I will keep this TLDR:

- My b12 is high (919) which is expected because I supplement 
- My vitamin d is perfect (128) 
- My folium is perfect (38,8) 
- My iron is low-ish (17) my ferritin is normal (63) (I’m going to discuss this, as I already supplement iron but it’s apparently not enough) 
- My thyroid is normal (2.0 TSH) 
- During my gynaecological appointment she did an internal echo and this didn’t show any excessive cysts on my ovaries, but did show one ovary that had quite a few, I currently don’t struggle excessive hair growth, acne, hair loss or any of the visual symptoms of PCOS, but I do a lot with diet/exercise/supplements, which might be the cause of that. 
- Liver, kidneys etc are all great.

But:

- My LH is 24 with a 7,2 FSH, which is a ratio of 3,3 (which is off) while I was on day 6 of my cycle when this bloodwork was done. 
- I’ve had cycles that became longer and longer (from 28/29 days like clockwork to 32 days to 35/38 to sometimes even 48). I’ve started acupuncture for this and my recent cycle (the one before this bloodwork) was 28 days again and I think I could feel my ovulation!

My doctor will be calling me in a couple of days, what are some good follow up tests/questions to ask for?

Are there any other reasons for the Lh-Fsh ratio to be off? 

Thank you so much!",2025-10-11 07:40:32,1,3,"Very confused about blood test results. Any doctors/experience experts here? Hey everyone,

PCOS,1o3abif,Very severe hirsutism,"Hi!

Has anyone else a very severe hirsutism? I have black long thick hair all over my body. And I’m scandinavian…. Whole back, shoulders, chest, upper arms, arms, hands, fingers, stomach, butt, thighs, legs, feet and even toes. I have a VERY wide spread beard that goes all the way to my cheek bones and neck and a mustache. Very few men have this big beard growing. Also got a thick unibrow. Honestly very very few men are even this hairy. Especially here in the nordic countries. I have looked up photos of serious hirsutism and haven’t found anything nearly as bad as mine. 😕I’m basically covered in black hair. The only place I wish I had more hair is my head. I have gone almost bald due the extreme male hormones. Which are higher than average male… I have been wearing a wig now for a year and i’m only 34. 😞 My endocrinologist admitted she has never heard of such a serious case. I shave my beard and mustache 3-4 times a day. It doesn’t even really help because the hair is so thick there is a stubble. I cover it with heavy makeup. It’s very limiting that I have to all the time think where I can shave the next time and if people notice the hair trough make up. And I have to apply it always again. Because of this I stay home a lot. During weekends I usually stay home and let the beard grow to give my skin time to heal. I also have a very bad acne. I pluck my unibrow and shave arms, hands and fingers every day. But you can still see the hair because of the thickness. It’s impossible to shave everything every day so I hide my hair with clothes. And how do you shave your back?! I’m very depressed and self conscious about all this. I go to therapy and we have discussed if I should just let the beard grow and wear what I want to. But I don’t have the courage! I have followed some bearded women in instagram. I’m extremely tired and desperate about my condition. If I grow the beard and mustache people will stare and make mean comments. And I don’t know what my employer thinks… Sometimes I dream of stopping wearing the wig and growing out my unibrow. This pcos is such a terrible disease. I’m very obese with bmi 64. So it’s difficult to exercise. Due to my weight I have arthritis in my knees and hips. My feet hurt too. I have type two diabetes, high cholesterol and high blood pressure. I’m now starting ozempic. What do you think of a woman who has a beard and mustache and is very hairy? I’m a virgin and have never been on a date. 😞 I can’t let anyone see me naked. What would you do in my situation? Should I go all out and be bald and hairy with unibrow? I’m worried I get confused as a man. I have a very deep voice because of the severe hormonal imbalance. I also have clitoromegaly. Don’t feel very feminine…",2025-10-10 15:21:57,13,32,"Very severe hirsutism Hi!

PCOS,1o3b32d,Lowered HOMA IR to normal,"Hi everyone, 
I (26F) have hashimotos and had been suffering from other hormonal symptoms like cystic acne for a decade, darkening of facial hair since last couple years, hair thinning, and reactive hypoglycaemia. I tried to manage my acne by retinoids and eliminating foods like dairy and sugar and eggs but my acne was very unpredictable and always came back. Same with hair fall, it could be due to low iron, thyroid levels or hormonal imbalance.

Last year i finally got blood tests done and while my cortisol, fsh and lh, other values were normal, testosterone was at 47 which is at the higher end and fasting insulin was 7.6.
This makes my Homa ir to be 1.6 and my post Prandial insulin was v high - 36.

Fast forward now, i changed my diet to have 80-90gm protein everyday, I’m 48kg. And around 120-150gm complex carbs as compared to my Indian diet of 200gm carbs everyday. I incorporated heavier weight strength training even tho I could do only few reps and i did progress than I ever could. I used to workout but with lighter weights earlier. I also have been walking 7k avg steps for the last 10 months. 

I tested fasting insulin recently and if was 4.5!! It makes my Homa ir 0.9 which is optimal. I couldn’t test post prandial insulin but i can see the difference in my acne and reactive hypoglycaemia. It’s not perfect and I still breakout randomly but less severe and same with hypoglycaemia, I can go longer without food without feeling dizzy. 

Just wanted to share my journey, and if you guys have any more tips. I also have been taking inositol, spearmint and omega 3 but u had been taking spearmint and omega 3 before too and they never controlled my acne alone.

PCOS,1o3ndag,Could Hives Be PCOS Related?,"
I’ve known I have PCOS for over five years now. Like many others, I’ve spent a lot of time trying to manage my symptoms and find what works best for my body. About three years ago, I finally found a diet and exercise routine that helped me feel great and I lost about 60 pounds.

I’m writing this because I’m at a loss and starting to wonder if my ongoing hives could somehow be connected to my PCOS.

About two years ago, I started getting hives—raised, itchy red bumps of various sizes. At first, they appeared on the backs of my thighs and went away within an hour, so I assumed it was a mild allergic reaction or skin irritation. But then, the hives started showing up every day for about six weeks, mostly on my thighs, and gradually spread to my calves and other parts of my legs.

Fast forward to now, and I’m still getting them. They come and go in cycles—I’ll have hives daily for a few weeks, then they’ll disappear completely for a bit before coming back. When they flare, they usually last 30 minutes to an hour and a half. Over time, they’ve spread across my body, and the reactions differ depending on the area. My legs, arms, and torso get raised welts; my feet swell and turn red, blue, or purple; and my hands swell and become very red. Up until recently, my face hadn’t been affected, but today I had small welts and redness across my cheeks and nose.

I’ve seen a dermatologist, but since the hives appear randomly, they haven’t been able to get a sample during an active flare. Bloodwork didn’t show anything unusual, so they referred me to an allergist. I’ve been getting weekly allergy shots for about a year and a half now, but they haven’t made any difference. I’ve also tried eliminating foods, changing products, and tracking potential triggers—nothing seems to connect.

At this point, I’m just wondering: could these hives be related to my PCOS in some way?",2025-10-11 01:27:50,1,0,"Could Hives Be PCOS Related?

PCOS,1o3czek,Just joined the Metformin club,"Hey fellow PCOSters, I have been reluctant to start this medication due to me trying it out years ago then having flu like symptoms for the first time in my life?? 
Tried it again but the second time only for 3 days and made me constipated? 
Anyway, my insulin resistance is like on the high high end of the limit but my A1C is within normal range. 

I really do not want to become diabetic and I need energy, better focus, and this weight to kickstart off. I KNOW this is not a weight loss drug, but I’ve been researching and reading so many posts and a lot of people HAVE dropped weight with this. Being that my A1C is normal, I’m hoping that due to a reduction in insulin resistance with this, I’ll shed the water or bloated weight. 

Anyway, I am taking this at night my prescribed dose is 500mg ER once a day.  I have been warned about the toilet troubles, but since I was previously constipated due to a kidney stone I have this might do more good for me! 

Recently I’ve let go of a huge stressor in my life so funny enough I’ve been regular the past week but still. 

Anyway! I want to keep this thread as positive as possible to avoid anymore anxiety taking this, but due to recently diagnosed Hashimotos I have to take charge of my health full force.

PCOS,1o37hyj,Birth control and heart palpitations?,"Around a year ago I (21 F) started on a higher dose birth control, because the lower dose wasn’t working for me anymore. 

And 9 days ago I suddenly began having crazy heart palpitation that terrified me and made me unable to sleep or do anything but try to stop the evil circle of having anxiety set them off more. But they’ve slowly tapered off to very mild palpitations every now and then but I’ve never had heart palpitations this strong for this long, I’ve only had them every few times a week. around 5 days ago I decided to hop off the pill to see if the birth control would be the perpetuator and they haven’t completely disappeared but it’s really strange because the palpitations have gradually become less and less and gentler. 

I’ve been to the hospital and done a lot of tests but they all came out normal-I’m getting a 24-hour ecg the 20th October so hopefully I can eventually get some more answers. 

Is this a normal thing with birth control?? Or is it pcos related/ hormone related or anything else related? Lacking supplements. Can it be anxiety, stress? I’m currently working with a psychiatrist to get anti depressants and anxiety medication due to having anxiety ever since I was born basically, but the revelation of my heart palpitations made her a lot less willing to prescribe them for me which duh is obvious because anti-depressants can cause heart palpitations and so on. Any help/ advice would be greatly appreciated🥲💗

PCOS,1o37avz,Advice for a picky eater/rant,"So I recently got diagnosed with PCOS about three weeks ago. I’ve recently gained weight. I was about 150lbs last year and am now 190lbs. Most of my clothes no longer fit, and it’s been really disheartening. 

I’ve been dealing with extreme fatigue issues and really low iron for a couple years now, and chalked the weight issue up to that since I wasn’t exercising and mostly eating Kraft dinner because I was to exhausted to actually cook. But when I mentioned to my doctor my period had been going for over a month and I was feeling extra exhausted, she recommended an ultrasound. Got one the same day. And surprise! Cysts in my ovaries! I have PCOS. 

Great! Surely knowing what’s wrong with me will help me find a solution! At this point I can deal with the weight later. The fatigue was making it so I couldn’t work. But my doctor looked at the results, and went “it’s pcos” and just starred at me. I had to prompt to get anything else and she just said weight loss. Everything else I’ve had to research myself. 

And I’ve been struggling. I like some foods I’ve seen, like broccoli and kale. But it’s so confusing! Don’t eat gluten or dairy, but have Greek yogurt and sour dough bread! Don’t have sugar, but have fruits but not those kinds of fruits. I feel like I’m loosing my mind. And it doesn’t help I’m a picky eater. It’s a sensory thing. I’m picky in the Kraft dinner, chicken nuggets, and plain hot dogs, my food can’t touch each other and I have to have my favourite fork way. (No I haven’t been diagnosed as autistic but every single autistic friend I have has all suggested to me that I’m on the spectrum.) 

It’s made trying a new diet for this very difficult. I can tolerate a little bit of eggs until it gets to the point that I can’t force myself to swallow them. I tried salmon and that was disgusting. Sweet potatoes are just… they’re wrong. Every recipe I’ve seen seems complicated and a nightmare to me. I’m really struggling.

PCOS,1o2unfv,Recommendations on how to manage my pcos naturally,"Some background:

1. Currently 26 years old. Bmi is currently 25 and it's a major issue for me because before, I rarely went above 21. 

2. Usually get my periods, although the cycle is irregular sometimes (28-40 days fluctuations). I rarely miss periods apart from 2 episodes - one when I was 18 and missed my periods for 4 months and another 3 years back for 3 months. Both were extremely high stress phases with little to no sleep, irregular diet and mental strain due to academic reasons. 

3. Hair growth over face, jaw beard line and chin, not too much but I definitely need to wax or shave in 1.5 weeks or so. 

4. Also losing hair on my head, not a lot but consistently.

5. Biggest issue- constant fatigue and brain fog. Which is a major issue because my job and education require a lot of mental and physical work ( not specifically hard labour but still, a lot of running, walking and standing). 

What I'm doing right now- 

1. A little irregular with my supplements - I take a cod liver oil capsule (daily ), vit d (occasionally) and vit B complex daily. 

2. Diet modification - trying to best to go low carb but it's verrrry difficult because I'm Indian and our meals are usually quite carb and dairy heavy. Trying to increase my protein intake too . Already taking plenty of fibre. Started taking seed mix a while back but have started seed cycle a few days back. 

3. 10 k steps daily, currently not doing any weighted workouts and no running and squats until I lose weight (it impacts a knee injury from a while back. it is not something that impacts me in my daily life, but pops up only IF I start doing these). 

4. Tried spearmint tea, still trying it but I can't have more than 1 cup a day as it somehow leaves me extremely lethargic and even sleepy  if I have more. Reduced ny caffeine intake.

PCOS,1o32foj,Metformin,I was put on metformin 500mg for suspected insulin resistance after pregnancy; w/ Possible(PCOS) she wanted me to try it while she was out of maternity the next 3 months I normally don’t get a period I was on BC my whole life w/o getting one up until I was pregnant. When I was younger I did have very heavy periods age 10(which is why I was placed in BC) after my c section I bled 8 weeks long then I didn’t for two weeks I had my first period; lasted 3-4 days nothing crazy and than had a 2nd one right on time the following month; again 3-4 days. As soon as I started the metformin 500mg I was a week late and I am bleeding through the heaviest pads you can find within 30-1hr minutes. Tampons have been a no go. I can’t keep up. I’m also not used to it as I’m almost 28 and it’s been so long since I really had an actual period but this seems like a lot. Is this the metformin? I bled a lot after my c section because I was actually clotting and was placed on thinners but this even seems excessive  to me.

PCOS,1o359io,I need help with weight loss,"I am on metformin and I feel this drug has made me gain more weight 

Had my test done and they are normal. My glucose and ac1 levels are fine. However my cholesterol ldl was 108 which is a little high. I think this just means I'm having bad food or something idk someone explain. 

I'm not the best at working out I do get into a small routine and then lose the routine. 
I managed to gain 5 pounds in one week and idk where this is coming from. 

I'm starting to get anxious by seeing how my weight has gone up 

I've changed my diet now for a while. No bread if possible I try and eat fruits and trail mix and sometimes I'll have a salad with protein in it. I've been really eating a lot of watermelon and grapes tbh. 
All of this but no difference in weight? 

What I usually eat Ina. Day 
Coffee 
Soup 
Trail mix 
Watermelon sometimes 
Grape sometimes 
Mushroom drink 
SOMETIMES( Mac n cheese and cabbage and green beans) I should probably cut the Mac and cheese !

It's just frustrating because it's like I can't keep up with having a daily walk cause my feet always hurt after work. And then I really try hard to not eat bread and stay away from it but apparently even eating fruit can be bad 
I've thought about just eating  konjac jelly and only having one meal a day but apparently even eating konjac cause digestion. Issues without water

PCOS,1o2hkwv,feeling like i was excluded from girlhood because of my PCOS,"hi everyone, i’m turning 23 this year. i’ve only had my natural period twice in my life, when i was around 16, and it never came back. a few months ago, i was diagnosed with PCOS. i still haven’t done all the tests, mostly because they’re ridiculously expensive and i can’t really afford them right now - and maybe, deep down, i’m also scared of what they could confirm. for now, i just know that my testosterone levels are very high, and i have a lot of cysts on my ovaries. apparently, that’s enough for a diagnosis.

when i was a teenager, i started taking birth control that induced artificial periods, so for years i didn’t really think much about not having a natural cycle. my gynecologist back then didn’t seem worried either - she just prescribed the pill because i wanted contraception. somehow, nobody thought it was weird that a 17-year-old had never had a proper cycle. but anyway, that’s not the main point of this post.

last year, i decided to stop taking the pill, hoping my body would finally figure it out on its own after all these years. well… surprise. it didn’t. my period never came back.

every day, i wake up hoping that maybe this will be the month it happens, that this whole thing has just been a long nightmare. but it never is. every month, i listen to my friends complain about cramps or PMS, and i can never relate. and honestly, i get so jealous. i wish they knew how lucky they are - how much i’d give to experience that. sometimes i even feel this tiny bit of resentment, and then immediately feel awful about it, because it’s obviously not their fault. i’d never wish this on anyone.

i’ve had moments when someone asked if i had a tampon, and all i could do was smile awkwardly while holding back tears.

because of my hormonal issues, my breasts are also very small, and i got bullied for it as a teenager. i used to stuff my bra just to feel normal. every month in school, i’d fake having my period so i wouldn’t stand out during PE. i just wanted to feel like one of the girls.

every time i got into a relationship, i panicked at the thought of having to tell the truth. i’m scared of not being seen as a real woman. i’m scared of being rejected because of my body. even when someone tries to be understanding, they can’t really know what it feels like - that constant guilt of knowing you might never be able to give them what they dream of. my current boyfriend told me early on that having kids is his biggest dream. i feel guilty, like i tricked him somehow by not being completely honest from the start. by the time he found out, it was already too late - we were too attached. and don’t get me wrong, he’s doing his best to be supportive and kind. it’s just… the guilt doesn’t go away.

my gynecologist told me that it’s probably impossible to restore my natural cycle. i asked if there’s any chance i could ever get pregnant, and he said that with proper treatment, it’s possible - but that i shouldn’t stress about it right now. but how am i supposed to not stress?

i just wish someone could truly understand what this feels like. i wish i could relate to other women’s experiences - to feel like i belong in that shared space of femininity. right now, i feel like an outsider, like a reject in the female community. i never know what to say when my friends talk about their periods, because i’ve never really had one myself.

i know a lot of women struggle with PCOS, but i’ve never met anyone whose cycle just never came back like mine. is there anyone else out there with something similar? is it really possible to live like a regular woman - or even get pregnant one day? :(",2025-10-09 16:53:19,24,15,"feeling like i was excluded from girlhood because of my PCOS hi everyone, i’m turning 23 this year. i’ve only had my natural period twice in my life, when i was around 16, and it never came back. a few months ago, i was diagnosed with PCOS. i still haven’t done all the tests, mostly because they’re ridiculously expensive and i can’t really afford them right now - and maybe, deep down, i’m also scared of what they could confirm. for now, i just know that my testosterone levels are very high, and i have a lot of cysts on my ovaries. apparently, that’s enough for a diagnosis.

PCOS,1o2btdw,Nurse is pressuring me into getting an ultrasound,"Hi everyone. I'm very upset right now and I don't know what to do. 
I'm 26, autistic, and a virgin. (Ik very sad)

I haven't had a period for 4 months, and my blood test results came back as my testosterone being abnormally high. I assumed under NHS guidelines this was enough to be diagnosed under the 2/3 thing. But my gp said he thinks i have pcos and that he's gonna refer me for an ultrasound. 

At first I was scared because I thought they'd do it at the GP practice but I found out it was at the hospital (ik I'm dumb), but then I found out it was a transvaginal one and I full on panicked. I do NOT want that. I don't want someone touching me down there. 
It got so bad my mum had to call the nurse back and ask them if it was needed, and they said they can't diagnose me without it, and basically the call went something like: ""i don't want it"" ""well too bad"" was how it felt like.

I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm being pressured into this procedure that isn't even necessary. I'm aware that it's ""over quickly"" and ""important to get used to it"" but that's beside the point. I feel like I'm being forced into this unnecessarily.

PCOS,1o2cylf,My Experience with Metformin,"I wanted to share my experience with metformin — sorry in advance, this will be long, but maybe it’ll help someone here who’s going through something similar.


---

How it all started

I’ve had PCOS for years. Since my very first period, my cycles were irregular (usually 50–60 days apart) and extremely painful — so bad that my mom had to pick me up from school. As an adult, I often had to take sick days because the pain made it impossible to function.

Every doctor told me the same thing: “Lose weight and it’ll get better.”
But even when my BMI was under 20, my cycle was still irregular.

Then about four years ago, I suddenly gained 15 kg (after previously losing weight), and my health just collapsed.
The worst part was brain fog and extreme fatigue after eating. Every day after lunch, my body felt like it was shutting down. I still remember walking to work after a meal and being so exhausted I genuinely wanted to lie down on the pedestrian crossing. I didn’t, obviously, but the urge was disturbingly real.

Whenever I mentioned this to doctors, I got the same dismissive response: “Try to lose weight. Everyone’s tired.”
My endocrinologist said my thyroid levels were fine (I’ve been on Euthyrox for 10 years), and my gynecologist couldn’t give me hormonal treatment because of a blood clotting disorder. That was the end of every conversation.


---

Discovering insulin resistance

Eventually, I got tired of being dismissed and decided to look for answers myself.

I found a podcast about PCOS where they mentioned the HOMA-IR test and explained insulin resistance. Suddenly everything clicked — the fatigue, the weight gain, the energy crashes.

I wanted to understand it better, so I read everything I could. Ironically, ChatGPT explained it more clearly than any doctor had.
They also mentioned that some doctors don’t see the point in testing for IR, so I decided to do it privately. In my country, there are labs where you can order blood tests without a referral, and HOMA-IR was one of them. It cost around €20.

The result came back above normal, confirming insulin resistance.


---

Hitting the wall with doctors

I took the results to my GP, who had no idea what IR even was, so she sent me to a diabetologist.
That turned into a nightmare — most didn’t want to take me.

When I finally got an appointment, the doctor’s first question — before even saying hello — was:

> “Do you want a baby?”



I said no.
Her tone immediately changed. She calculated my BMI (29), sighed, and asked what I even wanted from her if I wasn’t obese and didn’t want to get pregnant.

She said she couldn’t give me GLP-1, and that metformin is only for women trying to conceive.

I tried to explain that my IR was making my daily life miserable — constant fatigue, brain fog, inability to exercise, intense cravings, no way to stay in a calorie deficit without falling apart. I even brought her a detailed list of my symptoms and what I eat. She barely looked at it and told me those were “gynecological issues.”

Then she just said she couldn’t help me.
Only when I mentioned I needed a medical note for work did she reluctantly agree to repeat the HOMA-IR test herself — as if she didn’t trust my private results.


---

How I finally got metformin

After that, I went home and cried out of frustration.
Then I started reading posts here on this subreddit, and I saw so many women talking about metformin. Yes, some had digestive side effects, but so many described it as life-changing.

My brother told me:

> “Even if you have to go through ten doctors, don’t give up. And if it helps, just tell her you want a baby.”



So I did exactly that. When I called her a month later, I told her I wanted to get pregnant.
And suddenly — no problem. She prescribed metformin immediately.


---

The results after a few months

At first, I had some digestive issues, but they went away after a few days each time the dose increased.

In spring, I visited my endocrinologist (the only genuinely good doctor I’ve had — she listens and thinks). I told her I’d started metformin but hadn’t noticed major changes yet.

By summer, she called me saying my thyroid results had improved significantly and asked again why I was taking metformin, because it clearly seemed to be helping.
And she was right — around that time, I started to feel the difference too:

My period came after 30 days for the first time in my life (my previous record was 37).

My cycle stabilized around 30–32 days.

Cramps became manageable, I no longer need sick days.

The brain fog after meals disappeared completely.

My energy came back.

I started working out again and can finally recover normally.

My weight started going down.



---

The frustrating part

Metformin has literally given me my life back.
For the first time in years, I feel like my body is working with me, not against me.

And yet — I only got it because I lied about wanting children.
The doctor didn’t care about how I felt, only whether I was “reproductively relevant.”

Now I only contact her for prescription refills. I’m considering asking my endocrinologist to take over, since she’s actually supportive and understands what’s happening.
I’m just a bit nervous to admit that I lied — not because I feel guilty, but because so many doctors still react badly when a woman simply says she doesn’t want kids.


---

Final thoughts

If you’re reading this and feel dismissed or unheard — don’t give up.
Insulin resistance is real, and it deserves to be treated even if you’re not trying to conceive.

Metformin didn’t just regulate my cycle — it gave me back my energy, focus, and stability.

Her tone immediately changed. She calculated my BMI (29), sighed, and asked what I even wanted from her if I wasn’t obese and didn’t want to get pregnant.

She said she couldn’t give me GLP-1, and that metformin is only for women trying to conceive.

I tried to explain that my IR was making my daily life miserable — constant fatigue, brain fog, inability to exercise, intense cravings, no way to stay in a calorie deficit without falling apart. I even brought her a detailed list of my symptoms and what I eat. She barely looked at it and told me those were “gynecological issues.”

Then she just said she couldn’t help me.
Only when I mentioned I needed a medical note for work did she reluctantly agree to repeat the HOMA-IR test herself — as if she didn’t trust my private results.

How I finally got metformin

After that, I went home and cried out of frustration.
Then I started reading posts here on this subreddit, and I saw so many women talking about metformin. Yes, some had digestive side effects, but so many described it as life-changing.

My brother told me:

> “Even if you have to go through ten doctors, don’t give up. And if it helps, just tell her you want a baby.”



So I did exactly that. When I called her a month later, I told her I wanted to get pregnant.
And suddenly — no problem. She prescribed metformin immediately.


---

The results after a few months

At first, I had some digestive issues, but they went away after a few days each time the dose increased.

In spring, I visited my endocrinologist (the only genuinely good doctor I’ve had — she listens and thinks). I told her I’d started metformin but hadn’t noticed major changes yet.

By summer, she called me saying my thyroid results had improved significantly and asked again why I was taking metformin, because it clearly seemed to be helping.
And she was right — around that time, I started to feel the difference too:

My period came after 30 days for the first time in my life (my previous record was 37).

My cycle stabilized around 30–32 days.

Cramps became manageable, I no longer need sick days.

The brain fog after meals disappeared completely.

My energy came back.

I started working out again and can finally recover normally.

My weight started going down.



---

The frustrating part

Metformin has literally given me my life back.
For the first time in years, I feel like my body is working with me, not against me.

And yet — I only got it because I lied about wanting children.
The doctor didn’t care about how I felt, only whether I was “reproductively relevant.”

Now I only contact her for prescription refills. I’m considering asking my endocrinologist to take over, since she’s actually supportive and understands what’s happening.
I’m just a bit nervous to admit that I lied — not because I feel guilty, but because so many doctors still react badly when a woman simply says she doesn’t want kids.

Final thoughts

If you’re reading this and feel dismissed or unheard — don’t give up.
Insulin resistance is real, and it deserves to be treated even if you’re not trying to conceive.

Metformin didn’t just regulate my cycle — it gave me back my energy, focus, and stability.

PCOS,1o2n6iy,Day 101 without a period.... trying to get pregnant August 2026,"I am 32 years old, 130lb, 5'4"", BMI \~23, was just diagnosed with PCOS after 10+ years of thinking I had it. I was a competitive gymnast growing up. I had my first period at 16 years old. From 16-20 I can't remember exactly how many periods I had, but I remember being verrrrrry irregular and at one point going 6 months without a period. At 20 years old I went to the OB-GYN for the first time. He prescribed birth control. I was on the pill from 20-28years old. At 28 years old I started having spotting while taking the ""hormone"" pills (not the sugar pills). Went to the OB-GYN, I switched to the Nuva Ring. While on the Nuva ring from 28-32 years old I would ""bleed"" (so light) maybe once every 4-6 months. I was told by the OB-GYN this was a ""benefit"" of the nuva ring and ""totally normal"". Also, notably, I used to be 50lb heavier. I started gaining weight in college and was 160-180lb 22-27 years old (gaining and losing the same 20lb with diets). In September 2019 I started losing weight (and maintaining) with diet only (WW) then in March 2020 added exercise. I now exercise every day. 

I am getting married in August of 2026 (at 33 years old) and would like to get pregnant ASAP after the wedding. Therefore I went off birth control in February 2025 to try to ""figure out"" my periods. About 3.5 weeks after taking out the nuva ring in Feb 2025 I had a period. Then 45 days after that I had period #2, then exactly 45 days after that I had period #3. That was July 1st. No period since. (101 days ago)

* August 2025: ultrasound confirming PCOS - started taking inositol first 
* September Labs: Testosterone 77.8 (all other labs 'normal' - hgba1c 5.5%, DHEA 253, fasting insulin 4.9)

Supplements I have been taking since August: 

* Wholesome Story Myo-Inositol & D-Chiro Inositol

* Facial cystic acne: did 2 rounds of accutane -- 25 years old and 29 years old, acne is coming back AGAIN 
* Hair: mustache I have to shave or pluck, 2-3 chest hairs, 2-3 nipple hairs (all dark and long)
* Chin hairs - this is a new one as of LITERALLY last night, noticed 4 LONG chin hairs out of seemingly no where

Other things I'm doing:

* August 2025: 
   * Removed all the toxins and harsh chemicals from my house (harsh cleaners, fragrance, candles) and switched to Branch Basics
   * Water filter, only drink filtered water (was just drinking it right out of my sink before)
   * Cut down my caffeine from waaaaay too much to 1 cup of coffee a day
* 16 days ago: cut out gluten, dairy, sugar - eating only whole foods (Whole 30 diet)
   * 16 days without diet coke.... dying over here....

I am feeling very defeated, depressed, and infertile. I DID the thing, I LOST the weight and have been maintaining it for 5+ years! Why is this still happening to me??? I wanted to try to get a period back naturally (diet, exercise, cut the toxins, eat whole foods) but now I am desperate. Should I try metformin? spironolactone? GLP-1? Should I go back on birth control and then hope when I come off closer to my wedding my period will happen 3x again like it did earlier this year and then I will ovulate??? Should I find an IVF doctor? I have been spiraling since my diagnosis in August. Please help me get a period!",2025-10-09 20:58:18,3,6,"Day 101 without a period.... trying to get pregnant August 2026 I am 32 years old, 130lb, 5'4"", BMI \~23, was just diagnosed with PCOS after 10+ years of thinking I had it. I was a competitive gymnast growing up. I had my first period at 16 years old. From 16-20 I can't remember exactly how many periods I had, but I remember being verrrrrry irregular and at one point going 6 months without a period. At 20 years old I went to the OB-GYN for the first time. He prescribed birth control. I was on the pill from 20-28years old. At 28 years old I started having spotting while taking the ""hormone"" pills (not the sugar pills). Went to the OB-GYN, I switched to the Nuva Ring. While on the Nuva ring from 28-32 years old I would ""bleed"" (so light) maybe once every 4-6 months. I was told by the OB-GYN this was a ""benefit"" of the nuva ring and ""totally normal"". Also, notably, I used to be 50lb heavier. I started gaining weight in college and was 160-180lb 22-27 years old (gaining and losing the same 20lb with diets). In September 2019 I started losing weight (and maintaining) with diet only (WW) then in March 2020 added exercise. I now exercise every day. 

I am getting married in August of 2026 (at 33 years old) and would like to get pregnant ASAP after the wedding. Therefore I went off birth control in February 2025 to try to ""figure out"" my periods. About 3.5 weeks after taking out the nuva ring in Feb 2025 I had a period. Then 45 days after that I had period #2, then exactly 45 days after that I had period #3. That was July 1st. No period since. (101 days ago)

* August 2025: ultrasound confirming PCOS - started taking inositol first 
* September Labs: Testosterone 77.8 (all other labs 'normal' - hgba1c 5.5%, DHEA 253, fasting insulin 4.9)

Supplements I have been taking since August: 

* Wholesome Story Myo-Inositol & D-Chiro Inositol
* NAC
* Nordic Naturals Prenatal DHA, Unflavored - 180 Soft Gels - 830 mg Omega-3 + 400 IU Vitamin D3

PCOS,1o2j5k5,PCOS body styling,"Hi all! As so many of us on this forum, I'd like to vent a little frustration, and hopefully get some advice. 

TL;DR: fuck PCOS, finding it hard to be cute/sexy/feel comfortable with hormonal belly, please share your styling tips


Now, the long... my apologies, please bear with me if you will...
I've never been snatched, but I went from 49kg (I'm short, and have a small bone structure except for my oddly round ribcage) to 62kg in the span of two months with my PCOS diagnosis, and I'm having some trouble adapting to my new body. I'm very much a sundress, or random linen shorts and a crop kinda person... but now none of my cute clothes fit (without me screwing them up in the long run), and fuck me am I struggling to find a sense of style with this damn PCOS belly. It's been roughly a year and two months since the initial weight gain... lost 2 kgs by myself, then 3 on ozempic (that was a horror show)... and then gained back all five with a massive depressive episode caused by the ozempic. I'm aware my weight might seem kinda ""whatever"" - I have friends with PCOS that have a good 20+kgs on me - but 13kg is a significant gain for someone who is 5'2. I know all the things of eating right an exercising, and I'm getting back there, but the honest truth is I look the way I do for now and I'm tired of looking scruffy cause I refuse to accept it. I also have a holiday coming up with my bf's parents who are visiting from overseas, and even though he doesn't care what I wear/how I look, his whole family is fit af, and his mom will be taking photos left, right, and center, and I'd like to not feel like I'm a potato ruining the shots.

Does anyone have some advice for a nice YouTube channel, or someone to check out on Pinterest, or boards they're willing to share (DM if you prefer) with some inspiration? I figured there's no way I'm the only one feeling like this, and  that a discussion on the topic could be helpful and uplifting in general

I adore jerseys/knits, and have seen many cute styling options that involve them, but the climate where I live is hot 80% of the year, and I dont know about you guys but I over heat like a mofo. I've found some floopy/loose shorts that almost look like a skirt, and they're absolutely great! I'm currently trying to find tops that fit me width-wise, since I'm small sizing up doesn't always work well cause I didn't expand in all directions, but the smaller sizes have my arms looking like stuck little sausages which is annoying.

Also... any shoe advice for cute but comfy shoes? Since the weight gain I've been struggling with my feet getting uncomfortable very quickly. I have some croc sandals that help, but I cant really walk fast in them and they're kinda frumpy

Does anyone have a solution for shorts while your thighs are pressing together? I always had little chicken legs, and if I can be blunt I feel like I have tree stumps now... its very uncomfortable when denim shorts are folded and then you just have this heap of fabric squashed between your legs the whole time.. its so uncomfortable. 

Goodness, so many facets to style/fashion/comfort

F24/84kgs 

So I just came back from my gyno’s appointment requesting to prescribe me something to induce a period since I haven’t gotten mine since march and feel like I’m going crazy. 

and after going over all our options and excluding the ones that didn’t work before we landed on going on Primolut-n for 10 days to induce bleeding then going on Diane for 6 months while going on a low carb diet. 

Now I’ve been on Diane before for a couple of months 3 years ago. 
But back then I hadn’t developed my health anxiety yet 🙂.

Now I’m desperate to take it but I’m severely worried about the clot risk since I left work and I move around way less now that I’m back home. 

Should I suck it up and do it since it’s just 6 months? Aaah I’m conflicted 
Need some advice please. 🙏🏻

PCOS,1o2qggw,PCOS and Stress,"This is my first time posting in the community and I just felt like I needed to hear other people’s experiences with regard to handling stress and PCOS.

My period cycles have been normal for the past few months up until now, wherein I’m back to my usual long period cycle again ☹️ I can’t help but think and stress about it, and if only I could stop the period. The good news is I don’t feel any dysmenorrhea or migraine headaches unlike before. Stress might have been a huge factor since it’s our exams season in post-grad and an immediate member of our family just died over a month ago. A lot of adjustments still come up in our household.

I can eat sugar in moderation and control my food from time to time but exercise is way more difficult because I lack time due to the amount of topics we have to learn. It’s also hard *not* to think about PCOS when you are exactly in the field who is supposed to manage it.

PCOS,1o1yxj0,Late diagnosis and feeling so helpless and angry about it.,"I am currently 37. I've been dealing with with messed up periods since the beginning, when I was 14, excessive hair growth, and constant weight fluctuations in the early years. 

At 14-18 Doctors said ""just manage your weight"" I followed Jenny Craig concepts and did OK, but was inconsistent. 

When I was 22, I had my first miscarriage, followed by two more the next two years. Cycles were so inconsistent, I only barely knew I was pregnant before they happened. Doctors said ""there's nothing wrong with you, just lose weight, meanwhile, take this med every 3 months to start a cycle."" I tried many different eating styles trying to find anything that worked. 

By age 24, my cycles stopped all together. Still, doctors said ""no big deal, just lose the weight."" I tried everything I had previously tried, and new ideas. 

By age 27, doctor said ""you're pre-diabetic, here $500 in supplements, I don't do prescriptions. Lose weight or you cannot be my patient"" yes they actually said that. I started eating at extreme calorie deficit... That worked until I passed out too many times. 

At 30, new doctor said ""you're diabetic and have fatty liver, lose weight, here's 3 new meds to replace those supplements."" I tried again everything I could think of. 

At 32, literally 2 months into pandemic, new doctor(obgyn), over telemed, part way through me explaining my health history, and explaining that I've been told for years that nothing is wrong, that I'm just overweight, he says ""wait, you haven't had a single cycle in SEVEN years?"" well yeah, but I'm just overweight, all my tests show nothing is wrong. ""clearly SOMETHING is wrong, let's do these tests.""

Followed by diagnosis of Endometrial Hyperplasia, which, per the new doctor, if it had continued to go untreated, could have turned cancerous. So, 5 months into pandemic, schedule D&C to get my lining back to baseline. 
Return for follow up biopsies every 3 months to ensure it's not coming back. Here's 2 new meds. 

A year later at 33, ""let's put in a hormonal IUD to keep the hyperplasia under control"" 

A year later at 34 ""diabetes is out of control, let double this med and add 2 more"" 

At 35, new regular doctor ""liver function is out of control, lots of imaging, lots of tests, lots of meds, need to lose weight, see a nutritionist, here's a food allergy test, oh you're allergic to a lot of things"" 

At 36, more biopsies, also, let's do an ultrasound... Hey, you have 22 follicles in this ovary... 

At 37, you have PCOS, and insulin resistance, and ADHD, and Diabetes, and your cholesterol is starting to climb, here's 3 new meds, ""you should have caught these things earlier so you could get them under control"" 

I have been asking doctors for 20 years to help me. And I feel like I have been ignored, talked down to, bullied. I feel like I have literally done everything I can possibly do to try and fix my health, and I'm just absolutely livid every time I think about the fact that this SHOULD have been caught when I was a teenager. All I can do at this point is try to treat the symptoms. 

The only thing I have ever wanted consistently in my life is to be a mom. And I feel like that has been taken from me.

I see several posts in here daily about young people getting their diagnosis, and I'm so angry that nobody else ever took my health seriously.

Sorry for the long rant. I'm just so defeated, all the time.

PCOS,1o2hfg0,"Living with PCOS for over a decade, mental breakdown again","I’ve lived with PCOS longer than I want to admit. The older I get, the more alone I feel seeing that nothing seems to work anymore. I’m 28 now — physically active and have been watching my diet for the past 10 years.

I’ve been trying to manage it the past 10+ years  and have been seeing therapist and gynecologist the past 5 years. 
This year has been tough. I’ve tried everything the past year: Noom, more workout classes, cut back on eating out and sweets. Also seeing both a gynecologist and endocrinologist regularly. Got back on metformin and bupropion for antidepressants recently. 

Current:
	•	BMI: around 30
	•	Body fat: ~40%
	•	Cycle: every 40–50+ days, missing a few periods a year
	•	Symptoms: irregular periods, weight gain, depression, PMDD

I know my symptoms might seem “mild” compared to others, but it still feels like a huge weight I carry alone. No one around me really understands this struggle.

My PCOS timeline:
	•	Age 15: Diagnosed with PCOS. Periods were never regular. I’d struggled with obesity since childhood (BMI 33). Took Diane-35 and metformin, but my symptoms didn’t really improve.
	•	Age 18 BMI 24-25: Lost ~40 lbs through extreme dieting and exercise. My BMI dropped to 25. My periods weren’t normal at first, but after I lost my virginity at 19, they finally regulated for about a year.
	•	Age 20 BMI 26: Due to college stress, my periods became irregular again. Tried Junel and Sprintec for ~6 months but had constant spotting and horrible mood swings, so I stopped and decided hormonal birth control wasn’t for me.
	•	Early 20s: Focused on therapy, exercise, and nutrition. Took a nutrition class and saw a dietitian for six sessions. My BMI stayed around 26, and my symptoms were manageable for a year or two.
	•	Mid-20s BMI 27-28: Started gaining weight again and skipping periods. My gynecologist prescribed norethindrone for 10 days, which successfully “reset” my period and helped me lose some weight.
	•	Late 20s: After another year or two of stability, I gained weight again and tried norethindrone once more, but this time it didn’t work.

Now, my BMI is back over 30. I still work out 3–6 times a week (mix of weight training, cardio, and workout classes) and eat mostly low-GI, high-protein meals (only eat out 0-2 times a week, eat pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, and take supplement). I’ve listened to countless PCOS podcasts, read books, and honestly thought I knew everything I needed to manage it. But mentally, I just can’t do it anymore. I’m doing everything “right,” yet there are no results — sometimes it even feels like things are getting worse.

I’m so tired, both physically and emotionally. I’ve started avoiding social events and eating out because I’m scared of food and weight gain. I feel isolated, ashamed, and like my metabolism is broken. I’m trying so hard, but nothing seems to work anymore.

Has anyone else gone through this — where you feel like you’re doing everything right, but your body just doesn’t respond? How do you cope when the frustration and burnout hit this hard?",2025-10-09 16:47:37,3,0,"Living with PCOS for over a decade, mental breakdown again I’ve lived with PCOS longer than I want to admit.

PCOS,1o2gurc,please help me,"please help me I have no idea where to ask this

Hi everyone, I (18F) am experiencing a sudden onset of multiple concerning symptoms and I’m really scared. I’ve tried to get help from doctors but have been mostly brushed off, so I’m hoping for guidance on what I could get checked.

Here’s my story:

I’ve always been healthy until a few months ago when I went through an incredibly traumatic event 

Less than a month later I started experiencing severe hair loss.

About a month later, I developed cystic acne along my jawline.

A few days ago, I noticed my body hair, which has always been light, suddenly growing in dark and thick and in places where it’s never grown before such as my upper arms etc..

I also noticed my face being very puffy all the time. 

I went to see a gynecologist and got tested for PCOS:

No ovarian cysts on ultrasound

Hormones are normal except for high cortisol, corticosterone and cortisone 

NCAH test negative

Prolactin normal

I’ve never taken hormonal birth control

Other relevant info:

I’ve been tested for all common vitamin deficiencies and am deficient in almost none, only slightly low in vitamin D. My general blood work has been largely normal, except for a few mildly elevated rheumatoid markers and some other markers suggesting a minor histamine or immune response. I discussed these with rheumatologists, but after testing for ANAs, which came back negative, they didn’t consider it significant. A rheumatologist tested me and said my joints and flexibility are “great“ and he wants no further testing 💀

My periods have always been regular

I’ve never had extensive hair loss or hormonal issues before, not even acne 

I am extremely fatigued, which started months ago. I have moodswings. Complete loss of appetite. Constant headaches. Tachycardia 

I tested positive for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR 4.2) unexpectedly 5 days ago and am following a strict diet now. I’ve never had elevated insulin prior to this.

Hi everyone, I (18F) am experiencing a sudden onset of multiple concerning symptoms and I’m really scared. I’ve tried to get help from doctors but have been mostly brushed off, so I’m hoping for guidance on what I could get checked.

Here’s my story:

I’ve always been healthy until a few months ago when I went through an incredibly traumatic event 

Less than a month later I started experiencing severe hair loss.

About a month later, I developed cystic acne along my jawline.

A few days ago, I noticed my body hair, which has always been light, suddenly growing in dark and thick and in places where it’s never grown before such as my upper arms etc..

I also noticed my face being very puffy all the time. 

I went to see a gynecologist and got tested for PCOS:

No ovarian cysts on ultrasound

Hormones are normal except for high cortisol, corticosterone and cortisone 

NCAH test negative

Prolactin normal

I’ve never taken hormonal birth control

Other relevant info:

I’ve been tested for all common vitamin deficiencies and am deficient in almost none, only slightly low in vitamin D. My general blood work has been largely normal, except for a few mildly elevated rheumatoid markers and some other markers suggesting a minor histamine or immune response. I discussed these with rheumatologists, but after testing for ANAs, which came back negative, they didn’t consider it significant. A rheumatologist tested me and said my joints and flexibility are “great“ and he wants no further testing 💀

My periods have always been regular

I’ve never had extensive hair loss or hormonal issues before, not even acne 

I am extremely fatigued, which started months ago. I have moodswings. Complete loss of appetite. Constant headaches. Tachycardia 

I tested positive for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR 4.2) unexpectedly 5 days ago and am following a strict diet now. I’ve never had elevated insulin prior to this.  

I’m really worried this could be something serious, like an adrenal tumor, and I don’t know how to proceed. The onset of all this has been so sudden. My doctors have not been helpful, and my father is paying for testing out of pocket. I’m in Europe.

Is there anything else I should consider or get checked?

I’m desperate for advice or guidance. Any input would be deeply appreciated.

PCOS,1o2l2rg,Metformin or GLP1 for PCOS?,"Really curious about people's recommendations for this. After discussing my medical history with my primary care doctor, they prescribed a GLP1 and my insurance did approve me for coverage – although it was a bit expensive still. 

Later that month, I met with an endocrinologist for the first time, and due to the cost of the GLP1, she recommended I try Metformin first. I went on Metformin for a week and got a super mild rash, my endocrinologist had me stop taking the Metformin until the rash cleared up but would now like me to re-start to confirm if Metformin caused it, or some other factor. 

During that time, I got on new insurance which is now making the GLP1 very affordable for me, and so I am torn if I should go on the GLP1, or re-start the metformin.

PCOS,1o2aan0,PCOS - weight loss advice and tips,"Hi

I was first diagnosed with PCOS at 25. I’ve been able to manage it all these years with diet , exercise and at times metformin . I have 2 kids now and I used metformin for conception both times .  I’ve just weaned off my second baby and I am looking to reduce some weight . I’ve been deficient in vitamin D and B this past year and am supplementing. I do not want to take metformin again because I’ve seen that long term use depletes B vitamins . 

My body responds to vigorous exercise but I’ve always been on metformin to see any weight loss . Also with 2 small kids I cannot go to the gym and can’t do long workouts as well . 

What are my options? I  am turning 40 this week and I am looking for something that I can do long term ?

PCOS,1o2cmj9,Unexplained Amenorrhea,"
Hey everyone,
I’ve been dealing with amenorrhea (no periods) for a while now, and I wanted to share what’s happening to see if anyone has gone through something similar or figured out the root cause.

I have PCOS, diagnosed a few years ago. My symptoms have always been kind of unpredictable — weight gain that came out of nowhere around my teens, irregular or completely missing periods, acne, and insulin resistance. I don’t take birth control or GLP-1 meds ,and I’ve been trying to heal naturally through diet, exercise, and supplements like inositol.

What’s frustrating is that even when I eat clean, lift weights, and manage stress, my period still doesn’t come regularly. Sometimes I’ll get it while visiting India (I live in the US now), and then it completely disappears when I come back. That makes me wonder if it’s not just about hormones, but also environmental or stress-related — maybe differences in food, water, sunlight exposure, or overall nervous-system regulation.

I’ve also noticed that my DHEA-S levels are a bit low though not out of range and AMH is high, which makes me wonder if my adrenals are fatigued while my ovaries are still producing immature follicles that don’t ovulate. It’s confusing because high AMH is common in PCOS, but low DHEA-S isn’t, so I’m trying to understand what imbalance could be driving this specific combo.

I have high insulin and high A1C In pre diabetic range . 


Right now I’m tracking my cycles, managing insulin resistance, and focusing on sleep and emotional healing (I’ve realized childhood stress might have contributed to the hormonal dysregulation). But I’m honestly not sure what else to look into — cortisol rhythm, gut health?

If you’ve had amenorrhea + PCOS, what worked for you?
Did anyone manage to restart natural cycles without birth control?

Any insights, lab patterns, or recovery stories would mean a lot ❤️

PCOS,1o2666b,Feeling frustrated,"Hi! I am just feeling really frustrated and hopeless lately with my weight. I’m 24 years old, 5’2” and weigh 312lbs. I have always been heavier as I naturally am a curvier woman with large breasts and thick thighs but I rapidly gained weight in college (even though I was barely eating and exercising more than ever). I’ve spent years battling my weight and it feels like such a losing battle, I don’t know what to do anymore.

I was always extremely active when I was younger playing all different sports and exercising. I’ve been diagnosed with PCOS since I was 12 and just feel exhausted and infuriated. I’m tired all the time and no matter what I do it seems impossible to lose weight. I know many of you are thinking “calories in, calories out” but I’ve done that for years with no luck.

PCOS,1o2a6ib,pcos low estrogen,"waiting on endocrinologist appointment and idek where to start to prepare

i gained a bunch if weight from a surgery where I couldn’t have my usual super low cal intake just for maintenance. 

went to doc before throwing money at the problem and getting weight loss meds from hers or ro or wherever. honestly was just gonna see if insurance could cover it but i mentioned my sister has PCOS so he referred me to a gyno i was like f it whatever might as well.

i have some androgynous traits - a lot of nipple hair, thinning head hair, upper lip dark hair, sleep disturbances. my skin is great but idrc about that - my sister was once told she had “too nice of skin” for PCOS (direct quote) so it went untreated another 7 years. Anyway so gyno was like lets do ultrasound just in case and i was again like f it whatever might as well. still not thinking anything could actually possibly wrong. i just wanted to get back to ~starving myself~ lolllllll 

they didn’t specify exact count of follicles but said 20+ each side and uterus is apparently twice as “thick” as normal range (8.4 cm x 3.7 cm x 5.7 cm). ya’ll

they followed up with blood testing. testosterone ect were normal but my estradiol is <15pg/ml. what


*tldr - excessive follicles, oversized uterus, normal periods, very low estrogen, weight issues for as long as i can remember.
google tells me i’m in menopause. I’m 29F. * anyone presented with similar symptoms? any advice to prepare next steps i.e. endocrinology

PCOS,1o1orxf,Learned something interesting yesterday,"Learned yesterday that in August, the FDA approved Wegovy for the treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.

- periods suddenly stop? You're stressed, you'll have it.

-Pain during urination and passing stool? Water infection and constipation (I only have one kidney)

-Feeling very tired( no energy)even though I sleep well? We all have those days.

The doctor immediately gave me some stronger painkillers (I'm in agony) and referred me to gynecology.

I'm at the point that I'm in so much pain that I can't do the things I normally did day to day and am stuck at home (I have tried going out, but it was too much for me)

I haven't got my appointment date yet, but I'm hopeful something will finally be done to help with the pain and to help me get pregnant.

PCOS,1o1cg2t,Apparently thinking about sugar causes a sugar spike,"It’s like our bodies autopilot is broken! And It’s like we’re forced to build a scaffold for every single biological process our body was supposed to handle on its own. 

I found this study on an old Reddit post, thought it was interesting. 

Your brain can literally trick your body into a sugar spike. This diabetes study shows it's not just what you eat, but what you think you eat.

Scientists performed a psychological trick on people with Type 2 diabetes, they gave 30 participants the exact same beverage. But they put fake labels on them with some saying high sugar others said low sugar 

They measured everyone's blood glucose before and after. The people who thought they were drinking a high sugar drink, had their blood sugar spike dramatically. When they thought it was low sugar it didn't.

This is called ""anticipatory budgeting"" where your brain preps your metabolism for what it thinks is coming.


Since I got diagnosed I’ve been a lot more anxious about sugar and possibility of diabetes and sugar spikes. My brains even tricked me into thinking I can taste sugar in my mouth ( probably due to me eating bread and pastry on the weekend lol) This condition might be psychological as well as dietary. My brain is a dick head and loves to not listen to me so I’ll be having fun trying to mediate and also sort out my mental health.

PCOS,1o1uurm,Just Starting Pregnancy Journey,"Hi everyone! First time poster here. I (23F) have had irregular periods my entire life (usually 3-4 per year). I was formally diagnosed with PCOS around when I got out of high school. I was on BC from October ‘23-Jan ‘25. BC regulated my periods (not that that means much, lol). After stopping, I had a period in March, then nothing until 8/6, and it lasted about 5 days. Then, weirdly, I had brown discharge from 9/14-9/27. I never bled, and I’m still not incredibly sure what this means, despite a lot of research.

As far as I know, I have lean PCOS, and my husband and I are just starting out our journey. I’m a first timer here, so I’ll leave some results in case it helps:

DHEAS: 531.9 g/dL Free Testosterone: 0.88 NG/dL Testosterone: 81.29 NG/dL FSH: 4.1 mIU/mL LH: 13.49 mIU/mL AMH: 10.74 NG/mL

I have a full panel in case other results can help with the advice I’m seeking.

I have no one else in my life that has PCOS, and I’m working on re-establishing care since I recently moved and started a new job, but it’s been tough given the circumstances.

I just bought myo and d-chiro inositol, prenatal gummies that have DHA, Folic Acid, and Vitamin D, and a B12 gummy (have always been deficient in B12) that also contains CoQ10.

What have your experiences been with supplements similar to the ones I listed - is there anything I should remove or include? Will inositol help if I’m not IR? Any other advice in general, or holy grail products you use? Anything is helpful. I don’t have anyone in my life that has PCOS, and every time I research it I get a million different answers.

Everything is fine but my vitamin d is 9 ( it should be above 30) and also she told i have mild pcos which can only be managed by loosing more weight and maintaining a good lifestyle.

I am confused on how to make it normal. I have started taking supplements for vitamin d.

But i am scared for my periods. I dont know how to make it normal and bleed properly for 3-4 days.

Also a pointer - when i was obese i could do Chloé ting’s workout everyday my core was stronger but after loosing weight i am feeling little weaker than my past self .. is it because of vitamin d deficiency?

PCOS,1o1mgbf,Experiences with metformin?,"Not sure if anyone has similar experiences as me but I thought I’d ask to hopefully calm my anxiety!
I started 500mg metformin once a day 5 days ago and didn’t have any symptoms really. My tummy felt a little weird sometimes and I didn’t have much of an appetite. Yesterday (day 4) I started to feel shaky and my heart rate was pretty high. I had eaten 4 hours before this so I didn’t think it could be that I was hungry, but I sat down and had an apple with peanut butter and felt much better after about 15 minutes. So it could’ve been a blood sugar thing or an anxiety thing I’m not sure.
This morning while at work I suddenly felt like I was having a panic attack. My whole body went cold, my legs felt heavy, my head felt light, my heart rate was at 112 and I just had to stand up and move because I felt like I was going to die. I was able to calm myself down after about 5 mins of this feeling. I only had coffee with sugar free creamer at this point so again, idk if this feeling had to do with food.
Now I just feel a little off. I don’t necessarily feel dizzy or lightheaded, I think I just feel off balance if that makes sense?
Sorry this is so long, I’m just really hoping someone might know what I’m feeling. I saw someone mention that when you’re on metformin your body is adapting to a lower blood sugar, so that might explain what I’m feeling but idk?
I’m also on 10mg of Prozac for my OCD and depression, but I started that 8 weeks ago and never experienced panic attacks while on it.

PCOS,1o1nko3,PCOS?,"Hi all, i’m a 23y.o female. I’ve always struggled with irregular periods but it was more like i would have it one month then another i wouldn’t and then again the next. I’ve tried birth control in the past but stopped because i don’t want a “temp fix” well in the last 3 years i gained some weight 160-175 and noticed my cycles were again irregular. What concerned me was that back in july i bled from the 21 until august 21. it wasn’t heavy bleeding at all it seemed like spotting and then it would kinda go away but then it would come back. the last week of that i did have kind of a normal period like a normal flow. then on september 10 i stared bleeding again and again it was light not even enough to fill one pad but it wasn’t much spotting it was like some red and brown then it just eventually went away like the 3rd week. I brought this up to my dr and she ran some lab work. My adrenal glands looked normal, my blood sugar looked normal, my testosterone was mildly elevated but my dr mentioned pcos. i knew of this before but i never really thought about it because i don’t really have the symptoms most people do.

I’ve always struggled with irregular periods but it was more like i would have it one month then another i wouldn’t and then again the next. I’ve tried birth control in the past but stopped because i don’t want a “temp fix” well in the last 3 years i gained some weight 160-175 and noticed my cycles were again irregular. What concerned me was that back in july i bled from the 21 until august 21. it wasn’t heavy bleeding at all it seemed like spotting and then it would kinda go away but then it would come back. the last week of that i did have kind of a normal period like a normal flow. then on september 10 i stared bleeding again and again it was light not even enough to fill one pad but it wasn’t much spotting it was like some red and brown then it just eventually went away like the 3rd week. I brought this up to my dr and she ran some lab work. My adrenal glands looked normal, my blood sugar looked normal, my testosterone was mildly elevated but my dr mentioned pcos. i knew of this before but i never really thought about it because i don’t really have the symptoms most people do.

PCOS,1o1e02m,Do you bleed when you consume dairy?,"Am I the only one? I was diagnosed with PCOS at the age of 13 and I am now 26 years old. In the last 4 years I’ve dealt with the most irregular period patterns, like not having a period for months to just bleeding for weeks on end. 

Now, I’ve recently started taking birth control again but it’s 1:1 of estrogen and progesterone. I think it’s been over a year? Maybe 2 years since I started and only needed to up my dose once because I was bleeding in between periods. The most common factor in the cause of bleeding for me was eating a lot of dairy. 

For example, I might order chipotle and get a side of queso and chips, or ice cream, or Mac and Cheese. I usually feel fine after eating such things because I don’t sit there and stuff myself but there’s this weird sensation that comes over me and I always feel it in the pelvic area. Along with cramping and aching that go down my legs and it’s just really uncomfortable because it feels like my stomach is hurting but it’s cramps. 

As for the bleeding, it’s very light pink with the occasional clot that comes out really dark red… 

I’m not sure if anyone else has these experiences but if there’s any advice you could give me I would much appreciate your help!",2025-10-08 11:40:02,3,2,"Do you bleed when you consume dairy?

PCOS,1o1jgqy,Symptoms but no clinical markers,"Hi everyone!

I look like the poster child for PCOS - weight gain, especially around the middle, recurring acne despite being 36, and now hair loss that cannot be explained by my thyroid (my Hashimoto's is well controlled by a specialist) or any other lab tests I've had done. Got iron infusions for low-ish (not even catastrophic) levels in January with great levels since. Tested estrogen, testosterone etc. twice this year, all normal. No cysts on ultrasound or MRI.

The hair loss started with long covid two years ago, which I guess will be the explanation now since it can't be proven or disproven. The acne has always been there. The weight gain comes from inactivity due to fatigue. But taken together, this trifecta screams PCOS, right? Or am I wrong?

Wth??? I've never had issues with eating gluten. No gastrointestinal issues ever like im usually tired after a big meal but who isnt??

But my research that I've done says there can be something called silent celiac? Basically you don't show any symptoms until you have severe Celiac because you've been eating gluten. I also found this article about women's infertility and celiac. (Why is women's health still so understudied?! 😫)
